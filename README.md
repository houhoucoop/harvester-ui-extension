# harvester-ui-extension

The Harvester UI Extension is a Rancher extension that provides the user interface for [Harvester](https://harvesterhci.io) within the [Rancher Dashboard](https://github.com/rancher/dashboard).

> **Note:**
> This extension is available starting from **Rancher 2.10.0**. Ensure your Rancher version is **2.10.0 or later** to access Harvester integration.

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [official Harvester documentation](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/rancher/harvester-ui-extension#installation-on-rancher-210).


## Development Setup

Ensure **Node.js v20 or later** is installed for development and debugging.

### Standalone Mode

Run the extension standalone with hot reload at `https://localhost:8005`.

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start the development server
RANCHER_ENV=harvester API=https://your-harvester-ip yarn dev

# Example with specific server version
RANCHER_ENV=harvester VUE_APP_SERVER_VERSION=v1.5.0 API=https://192.168.1.123 yarn dev
```

You may also define environment variables in a `.env` file:

```env
RANCHER_ENV=harvester
VUE_APP_SERVER_VERSION=v1.5.0
API=https://192.168.1.123
```

### Rancher Integration Mode

To run as a Rancher extension, follow the [Rancher UI Extension Guide](https://extensions.rancher.io/extensions/next/extensions-getting-started#running-the-app).

```bash
API=https://your-rancher-ip yarn dev
```

## Commit Message Guidelines

This project uses [commit-lint](https://commitlint.js.org/) with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to ensure consistent and meaningful commit messages.

### Commit Message Format

All commit messages must follow the conventional commit format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Supported Types

- **fix**: Bug fixes
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **build**: Build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: CI/CD changes

BREAKING CHANGE: The /api/v1/vms endpoint has been replaced with /api/v2/vms"
```

### Git Hooks

The project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to automatically validate commit messages and run linting before commits:

- **pre-commit**: Runs ESLint to ensure code quality
- **commit-msg**: Validates commit message format using commit-lint

These hooks are automatically installed when you run `yarn install`.

### Manual Validation

You can manually validate commit messages:

```bash
# Validate the last commit
yarn commitlint

# Validate a specific commit
npx commitlint --from <commit-hash>

# Validate a range of commits
npx commitlint --from <start-hash> --to <end-hash>
```

## Branch Structure

- **`main`** – Main development branch
- **`release-harvester-vX.Y`** – Stable release branches per version series
- **`vX.Y-head`** – Testing branches for ongoing changes to extension builds in each release series

> **Note:**
> The `vX.Y-head` branches are auto-generated and kept in sync with release branches. Use these for testing the latest changes in each version series.

## Testing Guidelines

### UI Extension Testing

To validate changes in a release series, switch to the appropriate `vX.Y-head` branch. For main branch testing, use `main-head`.

- Examples:
  - Test `1.0.x` series → `v1.0-head`
  - Test `1.5.x` series → `v1.5-head`

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to **Rancher UI** → **Local** → **App** → **Repositories**
2. Refresh the Harvester repository using the target `vX.Y-head` branch
3. Go to the **Extensions** page and install the desired version

### Standalone Mode Testing

To test the standalone UI, configure Harvester to load the UI from an external source.

- Examples of `ui-index`:
  - Main branch → `https://releases.rancher.com/harvester-ui/dashboard/latest/index.html`
  - Release series `1.5.x` → `https://releases.rancher.com/harvester-ui/dashboard/release-harvester-v1.5/index.html`

**Steps:**
1. Go to **Harvester UI** → **Advanced** → **Settings** → **UI**
2. Set **ui-source** to `External`
3. Set **ui-index** to the desired URL
